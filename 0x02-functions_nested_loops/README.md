# C Programming: Functions and Nested Loops

This repository contains examples and explanations of C programming concepts related to functions and nested loops. If you're new to C programming or want to reinforce your understanding of these topics, you're in the right place!

## Functions

In C, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help organize code, make it more modular, and improve code reusability. This section covers:

- How to declare and define functions
- Function parameters and arguments
- Returning values from functions
- Function prototypes
- Function recursion

### Examples

You'll find examples of C functions in the `functions` directory. Each example comes with code and explanations to help you understand the concepts better.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops in C are loops that are placed inside other loops. They are used to iterate through multi-dimensional arrays, create patterns, and solve problems that involve multiple iterations. This section covers:

- Nested `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops
- Loop control statements like `break` and `continue`
- Practical examples of using nested loops

### Examples

The `nested-loops` directory contains practical examples of nested loops in C. These examples illustrate various patterns and problem-solving techniques using nested loops.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, clone this repository to your local machine and use a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and run the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-functions-and-loops.git
cd c-functions-and-loops/functions
gcc example.c -o example
./example
