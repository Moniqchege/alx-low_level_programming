This README provides a brief overview of fundamental concepts in C programming, specifically focusing on variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while).

Variables
In C, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They have a data type (e.g., int, float, char) and a name. Before using a variable, it needs to be declared with its data type.

Conditional Statements (if-else)
Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code. The if statement checks a condition, and if it's true, a block of code is executed. Otherwise, you can use else to specify an alternative code block to execute when the condition is false.

Loops (while)
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
